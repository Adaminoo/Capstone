# Capstone
## App Setup

When using the app, make sure to set up your `.env` file with the following configurations:

```
PORT=yourPort
SECRET='yourSecret'
DB_HOST='yourHost (Most likely localhost)'
DB_USER='yourDBUser'
DB_PASSWORD='yourDBPassword'
DB_DATABASE='yourDBName'
DB_PORT=5432 (or your port, most times it's 5432)
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with the appropriate information for your setup.

Happy coding!
